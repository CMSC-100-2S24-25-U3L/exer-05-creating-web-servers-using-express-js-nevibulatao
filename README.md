## Description

Created various functions that used request and queries via GET and POST methods

## Challenges encountered

How to compare the text found in the text file against the parameters given in the query as well as scoping

## Solutions

I used the readFile in order to examine the data within and split then into an array to better sort them. For the scoping, I adjusted the structure of my functions.
